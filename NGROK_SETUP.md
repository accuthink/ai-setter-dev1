# Exposing Your Local Application with ngrok

This guide walks you through getting a temporary public domain to connect your local application to Telnyx.

## What is ngrok?

ngrok creates a secure tunnel from a public URL to your local server. This allows Telnyx (which needs a public HTTPS endpoint) to reach your application running on localhost.

---

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Install ngrok

#### macOS (using Homebrew)
```bash
brew install ngrok
```

#### Alternative: Download directly
1. Go to https://ngrok.com/download
2. Download for macOS
3. Unzip and move to your PATH:
```bash
unzip ~/Downloads/ngrok-v3-stable-darwin.zip
sudo mv ngrok /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Verify installation
```bash
ngrok version
```

You should see something like: `ngrok version 3.x.x`

---

### Step 2: Sign Up for ngrok (Free)

1. Go to https://ngrok.com/signup
2. Create a free account (supports GitHub/Google login)
3. After signing in, you'll see your **authtoken** on the dashboard

---

### Step 3: Configure ngrok with Your Authtoken

Copy your authtoken from the ngrok dashboard, then run:

```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE
```

Example:
```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken 2abc123def456ghi789jkl
```

This saves your token to `~/.ngrok2/ngrok.yml`

---

### Step 4: Start Your Application

In your first terminal window:

```bash
cd /Users/senthilraj/Desktop/softwares/ai-appt-setter-dev1
./scripts/start-local.sh
```

Wait for the message:
```
Server starting on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

**Keep this terminal running!**

---

### Step 5: Start ngrok Tunnel

Open a **new terminal window** and run:

```bash
cd /Users/senthilraj/Desktop/softwares/ai-appt-setter-dev1
./scripts/setup-ngrok.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

You'll see output like this:

```
ngrok                                                                    

Session Status                online                                          
Account                       your-email@example.com (Plan: Free)             
Version                       3.5.0                                           
Region                        United States (us)                              
Latency                       -                                               
Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040                          
Forwarding                    https://abc123def456.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8000

Connections                   ttl     opn     rt1     rt5     p50     p90    
                              0       0       0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00
```

**üéØ Important:** Copy the **Forwarding** HTTPS URL:
```
https://abc123def456.ngrok.io
```

**Keep this terminal running!**

---

### Step 6: Test Your Public URL

In a **third terminal** or browser:

```bash
curl https://abc123def456.ngrok.io/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{"ok":true}
```

Or visit in your browser:
```
https://abc123def456.ngrok.io/docs
```

You should see the FastAPI Swagger documentation.

---

### Step 7: Configure Telnyx Custom LLM

Now that you have a public URL, configure Telnyx:

1. **Go to Telnyx Mission Control Portal**
   - Visit: https://portal.telnyx.com/
   - Log in to your account

2. **Navigate to AI Assistants**
   - Left sidebar ‚Üí **AI** ‚Üí **AI Assistants**
   - Click on your assistant (or create a new one)

3. **Open the Agent Tab**
   - Click on your assistant name
   - Click the **"Agent"** tab at the top

4. **Enable Custom LLM**
   - Scroll down to find **"Use Custom LLM"**
   - Check the box ‚òëÔ∏è **"Use Custom LLM"**

5. **Configure Endpoint Details**
   
   Fill in these fields:
   
   - **Base URL**: `https://abc123def456.ngrok.io/v1`
     - Replace `abc123def456` with YOUR ngrok subdomain
     - Important: Include `/v1` at the end
   
   - **Model Name**: `gpt-4o-mini`
     - Or `gpt-4` if you want to use the more powerful model
   
   - **Integration Secret** (API Key):
     - Click **"Create new Integration Secret"**
     - Name it: `OpenAI API Key`
     - Paste your OpenAI API key (starts with `sk-proj-...`)
     - Click **Save**

6. **Validate Connection**
   - Click the **"Validate Connection"** button
   - You should see: ‚úÖ **"Connection successful"**
   - If it fails, check:
     - Your local server is running
     - ngrok tunnel is active
     - Base URL format is correct: `https://your-url.ngrok.io/v1`

7. **Save Configuration**
   - Click **"Save"** at the bottom of the page

---

### Step 8: Test with a Phone Call

1. **Find Your Telnyx Phone Number**
   - In Telnyx Portal ‚Üí **Numbers** ‚Üí **My Numbers**
   - Note the phone number assigned to your AI Assistant

2. **Make a Test Call**
   - Call your Telnyx number from your phone
   - The call should be answered by your AI assistant
   - Try saying: "Hi, I'd like to book an appointment"

3. **Monitor Logs**
   - Watch your terminal where the app is running
   - You should see incoming requests from Telnyx
   - You'll see the persona being loaded and OpenAI responses

---

## Monitoring Your ngrok Tunnel

### Web Interface

ngrok provides a local web interface to monitor requests:

**Open in browser:**
```
http://localhost:4040
```

This shows:
- All HTTP requests going through the tunnel
- Request/response details
- Timing information
- Useful for debugging

### Terminal Output

In the ngrok terminal, you'll see:
- Number of connections
- Request counts
- Real-time activity

---

## Important Notes

### Free Plan Limitations

ngrok Free plan includes:
- ‚úÖ 1 online ngrok agent
- ‚úÖ 1 HTTP endpoint
- ‚úÖ HTTPS support
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Random URL that changes when you restart
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 40 requests/minute limit (should be enough for testing)

### Persistent URL (Paid Feature)

If you restart ngrok, you'll get a new random URL and need to update Telnyx each time.

To get a **static domain** (doesn't change):
1. Upgrade to ngrok paid plan (~$8-10/month)
2. Configure a static subdomain
3. No need to update Telnyx after restarts

---

## Keeping Everything Running

You need **TWO terminal windows** running simultaneously:

**Terminal 1: Your Application**
```bash
cd /Users/senthilraj/Desktop/softwares/ai-appt-setter-dev1
./scripts/start-local.sh
```

**Terminal 2: ngrok Tunnel**
```bash
cd /Users/senthilraj/Desktop/softwares/ai-appt-setter-dev1
./scripts/setup-ngrok.sh
```

Both must stay running for Telnyx to reach your application.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "ngrok: command not found"

Install ngrok:
```bash
brew install ngrok
# or download from https://ngrok.com/download
```

### "Tunnel not found" or "Failed to connect"

1. Make sure your app is running first (`./scripts/start-local.sh`)
2. Check that port 8000 is correct
3. Verify nothing else is using port 8000:
```bash
lsof -i :8000
```

### Telnyx "Connection Failed"

1. Check your Base URL format: `https://your-url.ngrok.io/v1` (with `/v1`)
2. Verify ngrok is running and showing "online"
3. Test the health endpoint:
```bash
curl https://your-url.ngrok.io/health
```
4. Check that Integration Secret has your correct OpenAI API key

### "Authentication required" from ngrok

Run the authtoken command:
```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_TOKEN
```

Get your token from: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken

### Calls connect but AI doesn't respond

1. Check your app logs for errors
2. Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set correctly in `env/.env.local`
3. Check ngrok web interface (http://localhost:4040) for request details
4. Look for OpenAI API errors in logs

---

## Alternative: Deploy to Production Server

For permanent hosting (instead of ngrok), you can deploy to:

1. **Cloud Platforms**
   - Heroku
   - Railway.app
   - Render.com
   - DigitalOcean App Platform
   - AWS Elastic Beanstalk
   - Google Cloud Run

2. **VPS Providers**
   - DigitalOcean Droplet
   - Linode
   - AWS EC2
   - Google Compute Engine

Then use your real domain in Telnyx:
```
https://api.yourdomain.com/v1
```

---

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Start your app
./scripts/start-local.sh

# Start ngrok (in new terminal)
./scripts/setup-ngrok.sh

# Test health endpoint
curl https://YOUR-NGROK-URL.ngrok.io/health

# Test chat completions
curl -X POST https://YOUR-NGROK-URL.ngrok.io/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4o-mini","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'

# View ngrok web interface
open http://localhost:4040

# Stop ngrok
# Press Ctrl+C in the ngrok terminal
```

---

## Ready to Test!

Once both terminals are running and Telnyx is configured:

1. ‚úÖ Application running on localhost:8000
2. ‚úÖ ngrok tunnel active with HTTPS URL
3. ‚úÖ Telnyx configured with your ngrok URL
4. ‚úÖ Call your Telnyx number
5. ‚úÖ Start talking to your AI assistant!

The AI will use the persona from `app/personas/default.txt` and have access to appointment booking tools.
